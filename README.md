- **Homework 1** --> ADT Matrix – represented  as  a  sparse  matrix,  compressed  sparse  column  representation using dynamic arrays.
- **Homework 2** --> ADT MultiMap–using a SLL with (key, value) pairs. A key can appear in multiple pairs. Pairs do not have to be ordered.
- **Homework 3** --> ADT List (interface with TPozition = Integer, IndexedList) – using a DLLA
- **Homework 4** --> ADT Map – using a hashtable with open addressing and quadratic probing.
- **Homework 5** --> ADT SortedMultiMap–using  a Binary Search Tree with linked  representation with dynamic allocation. In the BST unique keys are stored with a dynamic array of the associated values.
